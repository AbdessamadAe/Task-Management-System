# Task-Management-System

This is a C program that implements a task management system. The program uses a min-heap data structure to store tasks and performs various operations on it based on user input.

The program includes several functions for performing tasks such as constructing a heap, adding a new task to the heap, deleting a task from the heap, updating the time required to complete a task, sorting the heap, and saving the heap to a file.

The program reads a file named "ToDoToday.txt" at the start of the program to initialize the heap with the tasks in the file. The program then displays a menu of options for the user to choose from to manage the tasks.

Overall, this program provides a basic framework for a task management system and can be extended to include additional functionality as needed.
